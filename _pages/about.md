I will be a PhD student at CREST (Centre de Recherche en Economie et en Statistiques) at ENSAE (France), under the supervision of Roxana Dumitrescu, Nicolas Baradel and Caroline Hillairet. I am funded by the Chair "Stress Test, Risk management and Financial Steering", and I am grateful for Ecole Polytechnique and BNP Paribas for giving me this PhD opportunity on such topical subjects I hold a MSc in Quantitative Finance and a MSc in Actuarial Sciences, which promote me as an Actuary member of the French Actuary Institute.
